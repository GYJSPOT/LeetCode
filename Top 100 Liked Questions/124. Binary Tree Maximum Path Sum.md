## Problem Description (Hard)
```
Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes
from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections.
The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.
```

## Ideas
```
Three situation:
Node A as the "root" of the path
Node A's left subtree as the "root" of the path
Node A's right subtree as the "root" of the path
Set a global variable sum to record the maximum path sum
```

## Solutions
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    
    int sum = -2147483648;
    
    int help(TreeNode *root){
        if (!root) return 0;
        int l = help(root->left);
        int r = help(root->right);
        if (l<0) l = 0;
        if (r<0) r = 0;
        if (l+r+root->val > sum) sum = l + r + root->val;
        return root->val + max(l, r);
    }
    
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        help(root);
        return sum;   
    }
    
};
```
