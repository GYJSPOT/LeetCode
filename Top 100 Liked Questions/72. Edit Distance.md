## Problem Description (Hard)
```
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to 
convert word1 to word2.
You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character
```

## Ideas
```
Dynamic Programming
dp[i][j] means two words are the same up to the ith and jth position
change from dp[i-1][j] to dp[i][j] means insert a character
change from dp[i][j-1] to dp[i][j] means delete a character
change from dp[i-1][j-1] to dp[i][j] means replace a character
```

## Solutions
```
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int dp[word1.length()+1][word2.length()+1];
        for (int i = 0; i < word1.length()+1; ++i){
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < word2.length()+1; ++i){
            dp[0][i] = i;    
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < word1.length()+1; ++i){
            for (int j = 1; j < word2.length()+1; ++j){
                if (word1[i-1]==word2[j-1]){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1];    
                }
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = min(min(dp[i-1][j],dp[i][j-1]),dp[i-1][j-1])+1;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[word1.length()][word2.length()];
    }
};
```
