## Problem Description (Hard)
```
Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
```

## Ideas
```
Two ways: stack or dynamic programming
Take [2,1,5,6,2,3] as example.
First push 0 into the back to ensure the last several elements
s : 2
s : 2,1 since 1 < 2, we pop 2 out and get an area 1*2=2
s : 1,5,6
s : 1,5,6,2
    since 2 < 6, we pop 6 out and get an area 1*6 = 6
    since 5 < 6, we pop 5 out and get an area 2*5 = 10
    as we know 5 must be less than 6 so the width can be 2
s : 1,2,3
S : 1,2,3,0
     since 0 < 4, we pop 3 out and get an area 1*3 = 3
     ...
```

## Solutions
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
        heights.push_back(0);
        stack<int> s;
        int maxA = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<heights.size(); ++i) {
            while (!s.empty() && heights[s.top()] >= heights[i]) {
                int temp = s.top();
                s.pop();
                int width = i;
                if (!s.empty()) { width -= (s.top() + 1); }
                maxA = max(maxA, width * heights[temp]);
            }
            s.push(i);
        }
        return maxA;   
    }
};
```
