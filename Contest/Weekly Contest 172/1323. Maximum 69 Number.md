## Solutions
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maximum69Number (int num) {
        int length = (int)(log10(num))+1;
        for (int i=0; i < length; ++i){
            int div = 1;
            for (int j = 0; j < length-i-1; ++j){
                div = div*10;
            }
            int temp = (int) (num / div);
            int digit = temp%10;
            if (digit==6){
                return num+3*div;
            }
        }
        return num;
    }
