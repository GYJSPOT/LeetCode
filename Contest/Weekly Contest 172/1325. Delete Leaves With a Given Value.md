## Problem Description (Medium)
```
Given a binary tree root and an integer target, 
delete all the leaf nodes with value target.
Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, 
if it's parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, 
it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you can't).
```

## Ideas
```
Delete the left and right target leaves
Determine whether it can be deleted after left and right
```

## Solutions
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* dfs(TreeNode* node, int target){
        if (node==NULL) return NULL;
        node->left = dfs(node->left,target);
        node->right =dfs(node->right,target);
        if (node->val==target && node->left==NULL && node->right==NULL){
            node = NULL;
        }
        return node;
    }
    TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target) {
        if (root==NULL){
            return NULL;
        }
        return dfs(root,target);
    }
};
```
