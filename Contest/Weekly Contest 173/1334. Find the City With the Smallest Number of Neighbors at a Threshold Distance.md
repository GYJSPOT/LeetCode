## Problem Description (Medium)
```
There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1. 
Given the array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] 
represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities fromi and toi, and given the integer distanceThreshold.
Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at most distanceThreshold, 
If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.
Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities i and j is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.
```

## Ideas
```
Floyd Warshall: for city i, calculate the minimal distance from city i towards all the other cities
                for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)   // the first loop is the insert cities
                   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j]);
                insert one city between two cities and get a new distance
```

## Solutions
```
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheCity(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int distanceThreshold) {
        int INF = 1e9;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n,vector<int>(n,INF));
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); ++i){
            dp[edges[i][0]][edges[i][1]] = edges[i][2];
            dp[edges[i][1]][edges[i][0]] = edges[i][2];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            dp[i][i] = 0;
        }
        // Floyd Warshall
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j]);
        
        int mincount = 1e9;
        int count = 0;
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j){
                if (dp[i][j]<=distanceThreshold){
                    ++count;
                }
            }
            if (count<=mincount){
                mincount = count;
                index = i;
            }
        }
        return index;  
    }
};
